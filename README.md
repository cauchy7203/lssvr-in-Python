Least squares support vector machine in Python
LSSVR with one page file

In this repoitry we'd like to share the source code of least squares support vector regression (also LSSVR, LSSVM for regression, etc.), which was introduced by Johan Suykens in 1990s.

Details of the mathematical formulations can be found in his book

"Suykens Johan. Least squares support vector machines. World Scientific, 2002."

Directly run the demo_lssvr.py and you will see the results

Good luck and enjoy it!
